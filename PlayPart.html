<h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>. Be quiet—I think I hear someone in the hall. See who
it is, Petra.<br>

<h5>Petra</h5>. [opening the door] Oh, it's you, Captain Horster! Do come in.<br>

<h5>Horster</h5>. [coming in] Good morning. I thought I would just come in and
see how you were.<Br>

<h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>. [shaking his hand] Thanks—that is really kind of you.<Br>

<h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>. And thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd,
Captain Horster.<br>

<h5>Petra</h5>. How did you manage to get home again?<br>

<h5>Horster</h5>. Oh, somehow or other. I am fairly strong, and there is more
sound than fury about these folk.<br>
