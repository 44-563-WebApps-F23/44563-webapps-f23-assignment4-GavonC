        Mrs. Stockmann. Be quiet—I think I hear someone in the hall. See who
it is, Petra.<br>

Petra (opening the door). Oh, it's you, Captain Horster! Do come in.<br>

Horster (coming in). Good morning. I thought I would just come in and
see how you were.<Br>

Dr. Stockmann (shaking his hand). Thanks—that is really kind of you.<Br>

Mrs. Stockmann. And thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd,
Captain Horster.<br>

Petra. How did you manage to get home again?<br>

Horster. Oh, somehow or other. I am fairly strong, and there is more
sound than fury about these folk.<br>
